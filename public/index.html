    <meta name="description" content="In Robert Bissell paintings, the world of animals is a mirror for human existence, self-definition and self-reflection. Bissells work disarms by narrating vitally grown-up and urgent allegories in the guise of child-like humor, William Zimmer art critic for The New York Times. In a realm devoid of humans, the animal characters require us to consider our own condition and place in nature. Whimsical at first glance, there is an underlying tension and precariousness beneath. This allows us to objectively consider ourselves, without any familiar reference to latch on to. His paintings cause us to reflect on the environment, life, death, renewal and stages of transition departing from the safety of family, making our way in the world. Bissells work is full of charged meaning, lore and touched by surrealism. Influenced by the surreal legacy of Magritte, he mixes scales and uses gigantism with a variety of textures and subtle color palettes. Now living in Northern California, Bissell grew up in Somerset, England, and retains in his love of art, a love of rural life, Celtic legends and panoramic landscapes. After studying Graphic Design and obtaining a Masters Degree from The Royal College of Art in London, Robert moved to San Francisco and began a successful career in retail advertising. He now devotes all his time to painting and regularly exhibits in museums and galleries across the United States." />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
